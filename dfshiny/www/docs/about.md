The latest version of this open source software is freely available from the 
repository on GitHub, https://github.com/bokov/datafinisher_webapp/. 
If/when you deploy DataFinisher at your i2b2 site, it is recommended to run it 
inside your own firewall, and you definitely should not under any circumstances 
use this public instance with data that contains HIPAA identifiers (there are no 
geniuine identifiers in the demo data provided here). We are grateful to our 
colleagues at <a href='http://www.gpcnetwork.org/'>Greater Plains Collaborative</a> for developing 
DataBuilder, the app whose functionality DataFinisher extends.
