Once you are satisfied with the transform you created, clicking `Save` will 
add a new entry in the `Transform Columns` tab for each of the columns you chose 
in response to the third question in the current tab. You will need to go into 
each of those entries in the `Transform Columns` tab and click `Add` in order
to make each of those transforms active.


Then this tab will be cleared to make way for any additional transforms you
might with to create. 


If you click `Cancel` this tab will be cleared without saving any changes.
